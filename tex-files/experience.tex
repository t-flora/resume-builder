% Example 1: Experience that appears for QR, QD, and Tech roles
\begin{rolecontent}{qr,qd,tech}
\begin{experience}[San Francisco, CA]
                   {Eve Air Mobility \textnormal{(Aviation technology company backed by Embraer, 180+ FT staff)}}
                   {June 2022 - May 2025}
                   {Sales Engineer - \textnormal{\textit{Internal tools and operations modeling}}}
    \item Reduced code maintenance by 50\%+ for Python simulations for flight performance used by 7 engineers
    \item Unlocked \$350M+ in signed sales agreements via Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses
    \item Provided critical engineering data for advancing 9-figure negotiations for 6 US enterprise customers
    \item Cut map-building time by 70\% by building an internal TypeScript React application for data visualization 
\end{experience}
\end{rolecontent}

% Example 2: Experience that appears for QD and Tech roles only
\begin{rolecontent}{qd,tech}
\begin{experience}[San Francisco, CA]
                   {Eve Air Mobility \textnormal{(Aviation technology company backed by Embraer, 180+ FT staff)}}

% Example 3: Experience with mixed role bullets - appears for all roles but bullets are role-specific
\begin{experience}[San Francisco, CA]
                   {Eve Air Mobility \textnormal{(Aviation technology company backed by Embraer, 180+ FT staff)}}
                   {May 2021 - May 2022}
                   {Data Science Intern}
    \item Slashed peak memory demands by 90\% and reduced processing times by 4x for early-sales big data pipeline
    \rolecontent{qd,tech}{\item Designed API specification and business-logic diagrams behind \$500K+ proof-of-concept experiments}
    \rolecontent{qr}{\item Developed advanced statistical models for flight performance prediction with 95\% accuracy}
    \item Reduced routine competitor analysis time by 50\% by building Python-based models for named-entity recognition
